## Scala 2.13.4

Scala 2.13.4:

* Restores default global `ExecutionContext` to 2.12 behavior
* Improves pattern matching, especially in exhaustivity checking
* Adds experimental support for consuming some libraries built by Scala 3

and more! Details below.

### Concurrency

**NOTE** This is a change in behaviour.  If you use `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global` you may
want to adapt your code.  (But note that Akka is unaffected, because it uses its own execution contexts.)

In 2.13.0 we made `ExecutionContext.global` "opportunistic". This enabled "batching" of nested tasks
to execute on the same thread, avoiding an expensive context switch. That strategy requires
user code to wrap long-running and/or blocking tasks with `blocking { ... }` to maintain parallel
execution.

For 2.13.3, we restore 2.12's default non-batching behavior, which is safer for arbitrary user code. Users wanting
increased performance may override the default, if they believe their code uses `blocking` correctly.
We make that choice available via `ExecutionContext.opportunistic`.

Using `ExecutionContext.opportunistic` requires a bit of extra boilerplate, made necessary by binary
compatibility constraints on the standard library. Detailed instructions are in
[ExecutionContext.global's Scaladoc](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.4/scala/concurrent/ExecutionContext$.html#global:scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor).

Further detail: [#9270](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9270)/[#9296](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9296)/[scala/bug#12089](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12089), 

### Pattern matching

The pattern matcher is now much better at warning you if a match isn't exhaustive.

The following types of matches no longer disable exhaustivity checking:

* guards (`case <pattern> if <condition> => ...`) [#9140][]
* custom extractors (user-defined `unapply` or `unapplySeq`) [#9140][]/[#9162][]
* unsealed types, if you opt in via `-Xlint` or `-Xlint:strict-unsealed-patmat` [#9140][]/[#9299][]

Additionally,

* private classes are now treated as if sealed [#9211](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9211)
* singleton types no longer prematurely widen [#9209](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9209)
* tuples are handled properly [#9147](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9147)/[#9163](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9163)/[#9147](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9147)

If some resulting warnings are unwanted, your options include:

1. annotate the scrutinee with `@unchecked`, such as `(foo: @unchecked) match { ... }`
2. use `-Wconf` to suppress the warning, with e.g. `-Wconf:msg=match may not be exhaustive:i`
3. disable exhaustivity checking in the presence of guards and custom extractors with `-Xnon-strict-patmat-analysis`
4. disable exhaustivity checking of unsealed types with `-Xlint:-strict-unsealed-patmat`

### Scala 3 interop

This release enables the Scala 2 compiler to consume some libraries built in Scala 3. [#9109][]/[#9293][]

The new capability is experimental. To enable it, add `-Ytasty-reader` to your compiler options.

Not all Scala 3 built libraries are supported, because not all Scala 3 features can be supported.
The library author must stay within the supported subset.

For more details and caveats see the [Roadmap for the TASTy Reader For Scala 2][].

### Standard library changes

* When compiling on JDK 15, avoid clash with new `CharSequence#isEmpty` method [#9292](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9292)
  * The clash is avoided by making `CharSequence` wrappers in `Predef` non-implicit.
  * The change is binary compatible, but not source compatible. Call sites may need updating.
* Make `LazyList.cons.apply` lazier [#9095](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9095)
* Make `MapView#values` preserve laziness [#9090](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9090)
* Make `ListBuffer`'s iterator fail when the buffer is mutated [#9174](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9174)
* Un-deprecate useful `StringOps` methods, despite Unicode concerns [#9246](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9246)

### Compiler changes

* Allow using `classOf` with object type (e.g. `classOf[Foo.type]`) [#9279](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9279)
* Fix back-quoted constructor params with identical prefixes [#9008](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9008)
* Enable range positions (`-Yrangepos`) by default [#9146](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9146)

## Compatibility

As usual for our minor releases, Scala 2.13.4 is binary-compatible with the whole Scala 2.13 series.

Upgrading from 2.12? Enable `-Xmigration` while upgrading to request migration advice from the compiler.
