## Compatibility

As usual for our minor releases, Scala 2.13.4 is binary-compatible with the whole Scala 2.13 series.

Upgrading from 2.12? Enable `-Xmigration` while upgrading to request migration advice from the compiler.

Guaranteeing forwards and backwards binary compatibility implies we can't accept additions to the standard library (only modifications to existing code).  However we've created the [scala-library-next](https://github.com/scala/scala-library-next) project as a library that will start to contain code that will be added to a future version of the Scala standard library.
