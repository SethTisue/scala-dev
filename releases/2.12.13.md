Scala 2.12.13:

* Backports configurable warnings and errors from 2.13.x.  // TODO link to blog post
* Improves pattern matching exhaustivity warnings for patterns involving Tuples.
* Improves performance of building `immutable.{TreeMap,TreeSet}` by using mutation within
  the builder.

### Standard library changes

* To permit compiling on JDK 15, avoid clash with new `CharSequence#isEmpty` method [#9292](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9292)
  * The clash is avoided by making `CharSequence` wrappers in `Predef` non-implicit.
  * The change is binary compatible, but not source compatible. Call sites may need updating.
