## scala-dev

The issue tracker in this repository is used by to coordinate
and plan the ongoing work on the Scala 2.x major releases.

The canonical repository for the Scala distribution itself
is [scala/scala](http://github.com/scala/scala).

The list of [planned milestones](https://github.com/scala/scala/milestones)
in `scala/scala` shows how we are progressing towards the plans
in our [Roadmap](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12-roadmap).

Please use our [official issue tracker](https://issues.scala-lang.org) to
lodge bugs and feature requests, rather than using this issue tracker.
